                    <p>Growing up in a third world country, I always heard how difficult it was to own any vehicle past a bicycle. While 
                        the economic situation definitely played a part, there is no denying the role of the government and middle-men in aggravating 
                        the situation. Goverment imposed exorbitant taxes on vehicles while middle-men demanded their pound of flesh. While I cannot to
                        anything about government taxes, I can definitely cut-off explotative business-people. Join me in this journey.
